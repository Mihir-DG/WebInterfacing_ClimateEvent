## Modern Climate Events: Automated Tropospheric Global Profiles

This project looks to create a framework that allows a user to develop a list of useful atmospheric profiles automatically, when given a date. As of now, air temperature, zonal wind, and meridional wind are the only quantities considered. The system outputs a series of plots describing the week's events, and the changes in considered variables over this timespan. We use [NOAA's NCEP/NCAR pressure reanalysis](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html) data as our primary input. All variables are evaluated at 3 altitudes: near-surface, the 850 mbar pressure level, and the 250 mbar pressure level.
