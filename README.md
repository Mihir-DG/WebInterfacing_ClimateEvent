It's exceedingly common to require reliable data when studying a specific climate event, like a tornado, for example. Significant local deviations from climatological normals, (a 30-year average of a weather variable for a given time of year, eg. JJA) can help us improve our understanding of these events. Faster, more accurate, and stronger forecasting is only attainable through an improved understanding of the mean climate system from which weather stems.

That being said, it's still unjustifiably cumbersome to be able to use this data to draw meaningful conclusions. It's an unruly process that involves identifying relevant datasets (from hundreds of options), downloading dozens of gigabytes of data, parsing through data structures, matrix manipulation, and endless graphing parameterization to finally come to a basic understanding of the climate system's state at the time of the event. It's a fairly routine ordeal, but remains an ordeal nonethelesss. 

*autoClim's trying to change that.*

Essentially, we're looking to create a framework that allows a user to develop a set (see 'Output Categories') of useful atmospheric profiles automatically, when given a date. We wanted to create a system that's automated end-to-end, that gives you the full picture you need, when you need it. Used effectively, the sheer number of variables autoClim brings should be able to give you a high-level idea of what's going on in the system, so that you can figure out how and where to dig a little deeper. 

We try to provide greater context by supplying profiles for the week of the date input to the system (&#177; 3 days). Therefore, output filenames with the "day4" suffix are profiles for the specific date the user requests. We use <a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html" target="_blank">NOAA</a>'s <a href="http://www.atmos.albany.edu/daes/atmclasses/atm305/Kistler_2001.pdf" target="_blank"> NCEP/NCAR 1 reanalysis </a> for all our data requirements. We're completely open-source, having published under the <a href="https://github.com/Mihir-DG/autoClim/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank">MIT license</a>. 

To help  give you a better idea of what we're looking to create, we've attached samples to *finalOutput_plots/* for all currently-available output categories. The samples are currently centered on **November 7, 2020** (so, profiles are generated for the 4th to the 10th, inclusive!). Datasets (used for sample output) handled by the *downloadData()* function in **pullData.py** have not been added to the repository. For the sake of maintaining a clean directory structure, an empty stand-in text file has been added to their target folder.

**Execute *runMain.py* to create your own profiles! (Python 3.7)**

## Output Categories:

We strongly believe that autoClim's strength will lie in the diversity of the profiles it'll offer. Here's our list!
